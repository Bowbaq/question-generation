Aquarius (constellation)


Aquarius is a constellation of the zodiac, situated between Capricornus and Pisces. Its name is Latin for "water-carrier" or "cup-carrier", and its symbol is [Aquarius.svg] (Unicode â™’), a representation of water.
Aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the zodiac (the sun's apparent path). It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century AD astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is found in a region often called the Sea due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as Cetus the whale, Pisces the fish and Eridanus the river.


History and mythology
Aquarius is identified as GU.LA "The Great One" in the Babylonian star catalogues and represents the god Ea himself, who is commonly depicted holding an overflowing vase. The Babylonian star-figure appears on entitlement stones and cylinder seals from the second millennium. It contained the winter solstice in the Early Bronze Age. In Old Babylonian astronomy, Ea was the ruler of the southernmost quarter of the Sun's path, the "Way of Ea", corresponding to the period of 45 days on either side of winter solstice. Aquarius was also associated with the destructive floods that the Babylonians regularly experienced, and thus was negatively connoted. In Ancient Egypt, Aquarius was associated with the annual flood of the Nile; the banks were said to flood when Aquarius put his jar into the river, beginning spring.
In the Greek tradition, the constellation became represented as simply a single vase from which a stream poured down to Piscis Austrinus. The name in the Hindu zodiac is likewise kumbha "water-pitcher", showing that the zodiac reached India via Greek intermediaries.
In Greek mythology, Aquarius is sometimes associated with Deucalion, the figure who built a ship with his wife Pyrrha to survive an imminent flood. They sailed for nine days before washing ashore on Mount Parnassus. Aquarius is also sometimes identified with Ganymede, a youth in Greek mythology who was taken to Mount Olympus by Zeus to act as cup-carrier to the gods.


In non-Western astronomy
In Chinese astronomy, the stream of water flowing from the Water Jar was depicted as the "Army of Yu-Lin" (Yu-lin-kiun). The name "Yu-lin" means "feathers and forests", referring to the numerous light-footed soldiers represented by these faint stars. 88, 89, and 98 Aquarii represent Fou-youe, the axes used as weapons and for hostage executions. Also in Aquarius is Loui-pi-tchin, the ramparts that stretch from 29 and 27 Piscium and 33 and 30 Aquarii through Phi, Lambda, Sigma, and Iota Aquarii to Delta, Gamma, Kappa, and Epsilon Capricorni.


Notable features


Stars and planetary systems
Despite both its prominent position on the zodiac and its large size, Aquarius has no particularly bright stars, with its 4 brightest stars less than magnitude 2. However, recent research has shown that there are several stars lying within its borders that possess planetary systems.
Î± Aquarii, also known as Sadalmelik, is a G2 spectral class star (yellow supergiant) named in Arabic for the phrase "the lucky stars of the king". It is the second brightest star in Aquarius with a magnitude of 2.96 (though it has an absolute magnitude of -4.5) and is 523 light-years from Earth. It has a luminosity of 5250 Lâ˜‰.
Î² Aquarii, sometimes called Sadalsuud, is a G0 spectral class star (yellow supergiant) named for the Arabic phrase meaning "luckiest of the lucky stars". It is the brightest star in Aquarius with an apparent magnitude of 2.91 and an absolute magnitude of -4.5. Sadalsuud is 537 light-years from Earth and has a luminosity of 5250 Lâ˜‰, the same as Î± Aquarii.
Î³ Aquarii, also called Sadachbia, is a blue-white A0 spectral class star of magnitude 3.84 and a luminosity of 50 Lâ˜‰ that is 163 light years away. It has a luminosity of 50 Lâ˜‰.
Î´ Aquarii, also known as Scheat or Skat, is a blue-white A2 spectral class star of magnitude 3.27 and luminosity of 105 Lâ˜‰.
Îµ Aquarii, also known as Albali, is a blue-white A1 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 3.77, an absolute magnitude of 1.2, and a luminosity of 28 Lâ˜‰.
Î¶ Aquarii is an F2 spectral class double star; both stars are white. Overall, it appears to be of magnitude 3.6 and luminosity of 50 Lâ˜‰. The primary has a magnitude of 4.53 and the secondary a magnitude of 4.31, but both have an absolute magnitude of 0.6. Its orbital period is 760 years; the two components are currently moving farther apart.
Î¸ Aquarii, sometimes called Ancha, is a G8 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 4.16 and an absolute magnitude of 1.4.
Î» Aquarii, also called Hudoor or Ekchusis, is an M2 spectral class star of magnitude 3.74 and luminosity of 120 Lâ˜‰.
Î¾ Aquarii, also called Bunda, is an A7 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 4.69 and an absolute magnitude of 2.4.
Ï€ Aquarii, also called Seat, is a B0 spectral class star with an apparent magnitude of 4.66 and an absolute magnitude of -4.1.
Gliese 876, one of the nearest stars to Earth at a distance of 15 light-years, was the first red dwarf star to be found to possess a planetary system. It is orbited by four planets, including one terrestrial planet 6.6 times the mass of Earth. The planets vary in orbital period from 2 days to 124 days.
91 Aquarii is an orange giant star orbited by one planet, 91Â AquariiÂ b. The planet's mass is 2.9 times the mass of Jupiter, and its orbital period is 182 days.
Gliese 849 is a red dwarf star orbited by the first known long-period Jupiter-like planet, GlieseÂ 849Â b. The planet's mass is 0.99 times that of Jupiter and its orbital period is 1,852 days.


Deep sky objects

Because of its position away from the galactic plane, the majority of deep-sky objects in Aquarius are galaxies, globular clusters, and planetary nebulae. Aquarius contains three deep sky objects that are in the Messier catalog: the globular clusters MessierÂ 2, MessierÂ 72, and the open cluster MessierÂ 73. Two well-known planetary nebulae are also located in Aquarius: the Saturn Nebula (NGCÂ 7009), to the eastwest of Î¼ Aquarii; and the famous Helix Nebula (NGCÂ 7293), southwest of Î´Â Aquarii.
M2, also catalogued as NGC 7089, is an incredibly rich globular cluster located approximately 37,000 light-years from Earth. At magnitude 6.5, it is viewable in small-aperture instruments, but a 100Â mm aperture telescope is needed to resolve any stars.
M72, also catalogued as NGC 6981, is a small 9th magnitude globular cluster located approximately 56,000 light-years from Earth.
M73, also catalogued as NGC 6994, is an open cluster with highly disputed status.
NGC 6781 is a planetary nebula with a magnitude of 11.0, 2500 light-years from Earth. It appears as a near-perfect ring in a rich star field; the field is so rich that several stars appear superimposed on the nebula. Like the Ring Nebula in Lyra, the ring is approximately 1 light-year in diameter.
NGC 7009, also known as the Saturn Nebula, is an 8th magnitude planetary nebula located 3,000 light-years from Earth. It was given its moniker by the 19th century astronomer Lord Rosse for its resemblance to the planet Saturn in a telescope; it has faint protrusions on either side that resemble Saturn's rings. It appears blue-green in a telescope and has a central star of magnitude 11.3. Compared to the Helix Nebula, another planetary nebula in Aquarius, it is quite small.
NGC 7293, also known as the Helix Nebula, is the closest planetary nebula to Earth at a distance of 650 light-years. It covers 0.25 square degrees, making it also the largest planetary nebula as seen from Earth. However, because it is so large, it is only viewable as a very faint object, though it has a fairly high integrated magnitude of 6.0.


Meteor showers
There are three major meteor showers with radiants in Aquarius: the Eta Aquariids, the Delta Aquariids, and the Iota Aquariids.
The Eta Aquariids is the strongest meteor shower radiating from Aquarius. It peaks between 5 and 6 May with a rate of approximately 35 meteors per hour.
The Delta Aquariids is a double radiant meteor shower that peaks first on 29 July and second on 6 August. The first radiant is located in the south of the constellation, while the second radiant is located in the northern circlet of Pisces asterism. The southern radiant's peak rate is about 20 meteors per hour, while the northern radiant's peak rate is about 10 meteors per hour.
The Iota Aquariids is a fairly weak meteor shower that peaks on 6 August with a rate of approximately 8 meteors per hour.


Illustrations

In illustrations, the brightest stars of Aquarius are represented as the figure of a man, while the fainter naked eye stars are represented as a vessel from which is pouring a stream of water. The water flows southwards into the mouth of the southern fish, Piscis Austrinus.


Equivalents

In Chinese astronomy, the stars of the constellation Aquarius are part of the The Black Tortoise of the North (åŒ—æ–¹çŽ„æ­¦, BÄ›i FÄng XuÃ¡n WÇ”).[citation needed]


Namesakes
USS Aquarius (AKA-16), was a United States Navy ship named after the constellation.


Astrology

As of 2002[update], the Sun appears in the constellation Aquarius from 16 February to 11 March. In tropical astrology, the Sun is considered to be in the sign Aquarius from 20 January to 19 February, and in sidereal astrology, from 15 February to 14 March.
Aquarius is also associated with the Age of Aquarius, a concept popular in 1960s counterculture. Despite this prominence, the Age of Aquarius will not dawn until the year 2597, as an astrological age does not begin until the Sun is in a particular constellation on the vernal equinox.
